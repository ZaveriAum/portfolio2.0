                Hey, I'm Aum, a software engineer passionate about building scalable and high-performance applications across web and mobile platforms.  
                I work with programming languages like Java, Python, C#, and JavaScript, along with frameworks and libraries such as React, React Native (Expo), Node.js, and Flask.  
                My journey started with a love for problem-solving and system design, leading me to build microservices, optimize databases, and implement CI/CD workflows.  
                Iâ€™ve worked on projects like SportTrackr and Flashify, ensuring seamless user experiences and real-time interactions.  
                I believe in clean code, continuous learning, and turning ideas into reality through technology.
